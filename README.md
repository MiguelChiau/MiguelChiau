In Spring of 2020 I graduated from Quest University Canada with a dual bachelor of Arts & Sciences, I fell in love with programming
during my sophomore year, and I took as many programming courses as were offered I then enrolled on a Web development coding bootcamp, BrainStation in Vancouver, the summer after my junior year.
